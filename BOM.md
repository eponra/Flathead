- [ ]  **4x Rubber Feet** 
  - its not really important which one you choose, but they have to be 10mm in height, and can be up to 23mm in width
  - you can ofc simply design your own foot, or cut something to size that fit the existing feet, and add the 10mm in height

**All-in-all that's 370,26€. All that is without postage or customs, so this
price could still fluctuate a tad. You will notice that a lot of parts are from Mellow; this is because its the brand i trust, and also this helps with keeping postage lower**

Also, you could maybe save a few bucks left and right. It doesnt have to be
gdstime fans for example, and a 120W PSU will also do the job.  With that out
of the way, happy sourcing and building!
